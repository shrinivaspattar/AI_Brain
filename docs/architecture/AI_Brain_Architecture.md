# AI_Brain Architecture

## Purpose
AI_Brain is a personal, offline, privacy-focused AI assistant. It ingests
your own documents and notes, builds a searchable knowledge base from them,
and lets you converse with a local LLM that can retrieve and cite that
knowledge (RAG) and accumulate long-term memory about you over time. See
[[0001-file-first]] and [[0002-master-backup-is-read-only]] for the
foundational data-handling decisions.

## Stack
- Ubuntu 24.04, Docker
- Backend: FastAPI (Python), SQLAlchemy + Alembic, PostgreSQL
- LLM runtime: Ollama, running local chat models (`qwen3:8b`, `qwen2.5-coder:14b`, ...) and `nomic-embed-text` for embeddings
- Vector store: pgvector (Postgres extension) — vectors live alongside `documents`/`document_chunks`, no separate vector service
- Cache/queue: Redis
- Frontend: not yet built

Everything runs locally; no data or requests leave the machine.

## Backend module layout (`backend/app/`)

| Module | Status | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `ingestion/` | Implemented | `SourceScanner` walks a source dir; `ArchiveExtractor` safely expands `.zip` and `.7z` archives (bomb/path-traversal/disk-space guarded — see below); `DocumentIngestor` orchestrates scan → extract → persist; `text_extractor.extract_text` pulls plain text out of `.pdf`/`.docx`/anything-UTF-8-decodable, used before embedding. |
| `models/`, `schemas/` | Implemented | SQLAlchemy models (`Document`, `DocumentChunk`, `ImportJob`, `Conversation`, `Message`, `Memory`) and Pydantic schemas. `Document.import_job_id` carries provenance back to the import job that created it. |
| `services/` | Implemented | `DocumentService` (persistence), `ImportJobService` (job lifecycle, enforced state transitions, embeds documents synchronously during `execute_job`), `EmbeddingService` (chunk + embed + persist a document's text), `ChatService`/`ChatClient` (RAG-augmented chat over Ollama, conversation persistence, memory injection). |
| `api/` | Implemented | FastAPI routers: health, version, database, documents, import_jobs, rag, chat, memory. |
| `db/` | Implemented | Session/engine setup, health checks. |
| `core/` | Implemented | `Settings` (env-driven config: `DATABASE_URL`, `INGESTION_DIR`, `OLLAMA_HOST`, `CHAT_MODEL`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`, ...). |
| `embeddings/` | Implemented | `chunker.chunk_text` (character-bounded, overlapping chunks); `client.EmbeddingClient` wraps Ollama's `embed` API for `nomic-embed-text`. |
| `rag/` | Implemented | `retrieval_service.RetrievalService.search(query, top_k)`: embeds the query, ranks `document_chunks` by pgvector cosine distance, joined to source `Document`. Exposed via `POST /rag/search`. No reranking/relevance filtering beyond raw distance yet. |
| `memory/` | Implemented | `service.MemoryService`: flat `content` + optional `confidence`/provenance store, no type taxonomy. `POST /memory`, `GET /memory`, `DELETE /memory/{id}`. Read-only hook into `ChatService` (loads up to 50, most-recent-first); no automatic write hook from chat yet. |
| `tools/` | Empty stub | Tool-calling: lets the assistant act (run scripts, query local APIs, manipulate files) rather than only answer. |

## Archive extraction
`ArchiveExtractor.extract(files, destination)` (`app/ingestion/archive.py`)
dispatches by extension:
- `.zip` (`zipfile`, stdlib): per-member checks — path-traversal
  (`is_relative_to(destination)`), expansion-ratio bomb protection
  (`compress_size` vs. `file_size`, hard limit 1000×), then a disk-space
  check (sum of member sizes vs. a 10GB hard free-space reserve).
- `.7z` (`py7zr`): same three protections, with one structural difference.
  7z's default "solid" compression shares one compressed block across many
  files, so `FileInfo.compressed` is `None` for most members — only
  (typically) the first file in a block gets a real per-file value. The
  expansion-ratio check is therefore done at the **whole-archive** level
  (total uncompressed member size vs. the `.7z` file's actual size on
  disk) rather than per-member. `.7z` also gets a check ZIP never needed:
  `py7zr` recreates real OS symlinks on extraction (`zipfile` does not),
  so a symlink member could otherwise point outside the destination —
  symlink members are rejected outright, not validated.

Both extractors return the archive's extracted contents as `DiscoveredFile`
entries; `DocumentIngestor` skips the `.zip`/`.7z` container itself from
becoming a `Document` (only its extracted contents do).

Verified against two real files from the user's actual archive corpus
(metadata/listing only via `py7zr.is_7zfile` + `.list()`, not full
extraction — one is 13.6GB): both parsed correctly, confirmed solid
LZMA2 compression, no symlink members in either.

No other archive formats (`.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.rar`, ...) are supported yet.

## Chunking and embeddings
`EmbeddingService.embed_document(document, content)` (`app/services/embedding_service.py`):
1. Splits `content` into overlapping chunks (`app/embeddings/chunker.py`, default 1000 chars / 200 overlap).
2. Deletes any existing `DocumentChunk` rows for that document (idempotent re-embedding).
3. Calls Ollama's embed API in one batched request (`app/embeddings/client.py`) for `EMBEDDING_MODEL` (`nomic-embed-text`, `EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=768`).
4. Persists one `DocumentChunk` row per chunk, `(document_id, chunk_index)` unique, `embedding` as a pgvector column.

`EmbeddingService` itself takes already-extracted text `content`, not a file
path. `ImportJobService._embed_documents` (called from `execute_job`, after
ingestion) bridges the gap: for each created `Document`, it calls
`extract_text(Path(document.source))` (`app/ingestion/text_extractor.py`)
and hands the result to `EmbeddingService`, synchronously, best-effort per
document — an unextractable file or failed embed is logged and skipped,
not fatal to the job.

`extract_text` dispatches by extension: `.pdf` via `pypdf` (joins each
page's `extract_text()`, so a scanned/image-only PDF with no text layer
yields `""` — no crash, just no chunks), `.docx` via `python-docx` (joins
paragraph text), and everything else falls back to a plain UTF-8 read —
which is what makes true binaries (images, video, unsupported formats)
raise and get skipped, same as before. No OCR, `.doc` (legacy Word), or
other formats yet. Revisit sync vs. a background worker (Redis) once
import volumes get large enough that embedding noticeably slows down
`execute_job`.

## Retrieval
`RetrievalService.search(query, top_k=5)` (`app/rag/retrieval_service.py`):
1. Embeds `query` via `EmbeddingClient` (same `nomic-embed-text` model as ingestion).
2. Orders `document_chunks` by pgvector cosine distance to that embedding (`DocumentChunk.embedding.cosine_distance(...)`), joined to their source `Document`.
3. Returns the nearest `top_k` as `RetrievedChunk(chunk, document, distance)`.

Exposed via `POST /rag/search` (`{query, top_k}` → chunk content + source
document + similarity `score = 1 - distance`, `top_k` bounded 1–50). No
reranking or relevance-threshold filtering yet — it's raw nearest-neighbor
search over whatever has been embedded.

## Chat
`ChatService.send_message(content, conversation_id=None, top_k=5)` (`app/services/chat_service.py`):
1. Gets or creates the `Conversation` (a `conversation_id` for an unknown conversation raises `ValueError` → 404 at the API layer); persists the user's `Message`.
2. Calls `RetrievalService.search(content, top_k)` for relevant `document_chunks`.
3. Loads up to 50 `Memory` rows (most-recent-first) and the conversation's message history (capped at the last 20 messages), then builds an Ollama prompt: a system message (base instructions + numbered `[n]` document-context block, or a note that nothing relevant was found + a "What you know about the user" block from memory, if any) followed by the history.
4. Calls `ChatClient.chat(...)` (`app/services/chat_client.py`, thin wrapper around Ollama's chat API for `CHAT_MODEL`); a failure raises `ChatUnavailableError` → 503 at the API layer.
5. Persists and returns the assistant `Message`, with `citations` set to a denormalized snapshot of the retrieved chunks (`document_chunk_id`, `document_id`, `document_title`, `document_source`) — captured at reply time so a citation stays legible even if that chunk is later re-embedded or deleted.

Exposed via `POST /chat` (`{message, conversation_id?, top_k?}` → `{conversation_id, message}`) and `GET /chat/{conversation_id}` (full message history). Verified end-to-end against the real `qwen3:8b` model: it correctly cites `[n]` markers for document context, states memory facts plainly (no citation marker — the system prompt explicitly scopes `[n]` citations to the numbered document list only), and uses prior turns as context on follow-up questions. Single blocking response only — no streaming yet.

## Memory
`Memory` (`app/models/memory.py`): `content` (the fact/preference itself),
optional `confidence` (0–1), optional provenance (`conversation_id`/
`message_id` it was derived from — null for anything written directly via
the API). No `memory_type` taxonomy (episodic/semantic/preference/etc.) —
the original project brief explicitly said not to invent one until
something in the actual implementation needs it, and nothing does yet.

`MemoryService` (`app/memory/service.py`): `create_memory`, `get_memory`,
`list_memories` (most-recent-first, capped), `delete_memory` (raises
`ValueError` → 404 if missing). Exposed via `POST /memory`, `GET /memory`,
`DELETE /memory/{id}`.

Read-only hook into `ChatService` today: every chat turn loads up to 50
memories and injects them into the prompt (see Chat, above). There is
deliberately no write hook yet — nothing in the chat loop automatically
extracts "facts" from casual conversation into memory. An LLM silently
deciding what's worth remembering is a real trust/quality risk (a
hallucinated "fact" becoming permanent, unreviewed context for every future
turn); that needs its own deliberate design — e.g. a confidence threshold,
an explicit confirmation step, or a review queue akin to the KRM backlog's
"Confidence Review Queue" — not a default-on side effect of chatting.
Memory retrieval is "most recent N", not similarity-ranked like document
retrieval; revisit if the store grows large enough that recency stops
being a good proxy for relevance.

## Import job lifecycle
`ImportJob.status` is a state machine (`app/models/import_job.py`):

```
PENDING ──execute_job──▶ RUNNING ──mark_completed──▶ COMPLETED
   ▲                        │
   └────mark_running────────┘ (retry after FAILED)
                             │
                             ▼
                           FAILED
```
`mark_running` only accepts jobs in `PENDING` or `FAILED` (retry). `mark_completed`
only accepts jobs in `RUNNING`. `execute_job` refuses jobs already `RUNNING`,
`PAUSED`, `COMPLETED`, or `CANCELLED`. Invalid transitions raise `ValueError`
and are surfaced as 409 Conflict at the API layer.

## On-disk layout
- `documents/imports/<job_id>/` — working copies produced by ingestion for a
  given import job. Derived, disposable, safe to delete and re-ingest.
- `knowledge/` — reserved for curated/derived knowledge artifacts (future).
- `postgres/`, `redis/` — data directories for the Dockerized services.
- `logs/`, `config/`, `prompts/`, `scripts/` — reserved, currently empty.

## Open/planned areas
- `docker-compose.yml` is currently empty — services (Postgres, Redis,
  Ollama) are expected to run some other way for now (e.g. local
  installs) until Compose is filled in.
- The `vector` Postgres extension (`postgresql-16-pgvector`) and the
  `document_chunks` migration are applied on this host, but neither step
  is automated yet — a fresh machine needs both done manually before
  `EmbeddingService` will work.
- No frontend yet; the backend is API-only.
- See [`docs/backlog.md`](../backlog.md) for prioritized future work
  (provenance chain, dedup, audit log, etc.) and
  [`docs/roadmap/Roadmap.md`](../roadmap/Roadmap.md) for the phased plan.
